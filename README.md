# vim-cheatsheet
This is the collection of (neo)vim tips that I wish I knew when I started

## Basic movement 
DO not leave the home row! `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` are your best friend from now on :) 
`h` - left
`j` - down
`k` - up 
`l` - right 



## Misc
#### make lines lowercase or uppercase 
With visual mode, select text and `u` for lowercase `U` for uppercase
